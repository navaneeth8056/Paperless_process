Project Overview
This project is aimed at simplifying the process of applying for a driving license by integrating chatbots into a user-friendly website. The system also includes specialized logins for police and collectors to enhance law enforcement and data analysis. The chatbots have been developed using Generative AI and Dialogue Flow, while a machine learning model is employed for certain functionalities. Additionally, MySQL is integrated for the police login chatbot, and a voice prompt system enhances the overall accessibility of the website.

Features
1. User-Friendly Website
The website provides a seamless experience for users to apply for a driving license. It includes an intuitive interface, form validation, and easy navigation.

2. Chatbot Integration
Generative AI and Dialogue Flow are utilized to create intelligent chatbots that assist users throughout the application process. The chatbots provide real-time responses to user queries and guide them through the necessary steps.

3. Police Login
Suspension of License: The police login allows law enforcement to suspend a driving license in case of rash driving or other violations. This is facilitated through a machine learning model that analyzes driving behavior.

MySQL Integration: The police login chatbot is integrated with a MySQL database to efficiently manage and retrieve relevant data for license suspension.

4. Collector Login
Data Analysis Dashboard: The collector login provides access to a dashboard created using PowerBI. This dashboard displays statistical data and trends related to driving licenses, violations, and suspensions. It aids collectors in making informed decisions and implementing policies.
5. Voice Prompt System
The entire website incorporates a voice prompt system to enhance accessibility. Users can navigate the site and complete tasks using voice commands, making it more inclusive for individuals with different abilities.
